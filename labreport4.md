[UP], [UP], [UP], [UP], [UP], [ENTER]: Due to me using this command before, the line to log into the virtual machine was already saved in the command history. The command executed was a login command `ssh chp027@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu`. The command was 5 up in the search history, so I hit up 5 times and pressed enter to execute it.

[UP], [UP], [UP], [UP], [UP], [ENTER]: Similarly to the previous example this command was also saved in the command history. I hit the up key 5 times to get the command `git clone git@github.com:phanc2069/lab7Forked.git`, which looks at the link and clones the repository into the awd.

[c], [d], [SPACE], [l], [a], [b], [7], [SHIFT+f], [TAB], [ENTER]: I pushed the keys in so I could change the awd to the directory that I just cloned (lab7Forked/). The tab was to autofill the rest of the directory name. The command is `cd lab7Forked/`. Yes it would of been faster to go into the command history according to the number of keys, but this was just muscle memory jumping in.
